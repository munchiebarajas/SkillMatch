All the important files that the program uses is in the Final Projects map.
Make sure that you have flask installed and start the program by running
python skillmath.py when in the FinalProject directory. Open a web browser
and enter the given url to launch the website. It first takes you to an
index site with some information and by clicking the "Take the Quiz" button
you will be tasked with filling in a short form. After giving your answers
the program will generate job recommendations tailored to your preferences.
The data used can easily be updated by running a dataset from a different
year through the dataset_cleaner.py and then through the occupation_profiles.py
to create the occupation profiles and their corresponding data. Then simply read
those in the skillmatch.py instead of the old datasets.
